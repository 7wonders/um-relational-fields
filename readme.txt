== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I add relationships? =

In WP Admin, go to Ultimate Member -> Settings -> Field Relationships

= In what order should I create a new relationship? =

First, create a new `dropdown` or `multiselect` field in the UM Form Builder. Note the field meta key.

Then, create a new relationship, using the meta key of the field you just created.

= What should I enter in the options area when I create a new field? =

Anything. UM won't allow you to create a new `dropdown` or `multiselect` field if you leave the options area empty, so just put in any value. This plugin wil override whatever you input there.

= How do I add a new Post Type or Taxonomy? =

If you're new to this, use something like the [Custom Post Type UI plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/) to create new post types and taxonomies.
